# README for the Next Actionable Critical Dependency Weighting Feature

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for the Next Actionable Critical Dependency weighting feature, based on the proposal [Weighting the Next Actionable Critical Dependency Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xb86MrKFQZQNq9rCQb08Dk1b5HU7nzLHkzfjBvbndeM/edit?usp=sharing). The core objective of this feature is to enhance the understanding and management of dependencies within a project by applying a sigmoid-based weighting function. This approach was chosen over the OpenSSF Criticality Score-based function for its flexibility and adaptability to various project needs.

## Feature Description

The Next Actionable Critical Dependency weighting feature introduces a novel approach to evaluate and prioritize project dependencies. By leveraging a sigmoid-based function, it offers a nuanced and dynamic method to assess the importance and urgency of updating or maintaining dependencies. This method is particularly effective in distinguishing between dependencies that are critical to the project's success and those that are less significant.

### Key Components

- **Sigmoid-Based Weighting Function**: Utilizes a sigmoid curve to assign weights to dependencies, ensuring a balanced approach to dependency management. This function is designed to mitigate the extremes of over-prioritizing or neglecting certain dependencies.
- **Customization Layer**: Allows for project-specific adjustments to the weighting function, enabling teams to tailor the evaluation process according to their unique requirements and priorities.
- **Dependency Evaluation Tool**: A comprehensive tool that scans the project's dependencies, applies the sigmoid-based weighting function, and outputs a prioritized list of dependencies requiring attention.

### Understanding the Algorithm

To understand the algorithm please take a look at the proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xb86MrKFQZQNq9rCQb08Dk1b5HU7nzLHkzfjBvbndeM/edit?usp=sharing 

## Conclusion

The Next Actionable Critical Dependency weighting feature represents a significant advancement in dependency management, offering a sophisticated yet adaptable approach to prioritizing project dependencies. By implementing this feature, teams can ensure that their projects remain secure, stable, and up-to-date, effectively mitigating the risks associated with outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
